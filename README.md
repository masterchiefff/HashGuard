# HashGuard Hackathon Pitch
Welcome to HashGuard: The Future of Micron Insurance for Boda Boda Riders! 
## Problem Statement

Boda boda (motorcycle) riders are subjected to everyday risks on the road, from accidents to motorbike theft, but the majority of them lack an affordable and convenient insurance cover. Traditional insurance is expensive, tedious, and entails extensive documentation, thus out of reach to most riders.

## Solution: HashGuard

HashGuard is a tokenized micron insurance platform tailored for boda boda riders. It provides instant, low-cost, and easy-to-use insurance powered by Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR)—without requiring users to know anything about blockchain

## Key Features

Hassle-Free Experience – Riders get an insurance account without a wallet or blockchain knowledge.

Preloaded Accounts – Every rider's account comes with preloaded HBAR for transactions, so there's no onboarding friction.

Tokenized Micron Insurance – Insurance policies are tokenized, thus can be instantly activated, verified, and claimed.

Fast & Low-Cost Transactions – Powered by Hedera Hashgraph, guaranteeing secure, near-instant, and low-cost transactions.

Automated Payouts – Riders are paid immediately once an accident is verified, no bureaucracy.

## How It Works

Sign Up – Riders sign up with their phone number, no crypto know-how required.

Choose a Plan – There are low-cost tokenized insurance plans based on needs.

Peace of Mind Riding – Automatic coverage is taken care of on the blockchain.
